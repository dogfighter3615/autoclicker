# autoclicker
autoclicker for minecraft
An autoclicker used to simulate clicks to minecraft, you can either set it to clicking randomly in an interval or set a fixed interval.
You can currently select every window, but the program works best in a minecraft window, I don't know how other programs will react to it since it clicks on (0,0)
